The Scripts in this folder were strictly used to generate stored procedures, as well as a data access layer based on THE ROUTE 66 SYSTEM database.
Under no circumstances should these scripts be run, since they were already used and will cause fatal problems when running them again.

Order the scripts were run in:
 -SCRIPT 1: which produce SCRIPT 2
 -SCRIPT 2: Which were produced by SCRIPT 1
 -SCRIPT 3: which produce c# code which are copied into the source code under the folder DAT, into a class file DataAccess.cs
